> A shipit deployment task without git requirements. 

Task is to just copy some local artefacts to a remote location. This is esp. usefull in Continous-Delivery-Scenarios. And that's why the package appended `cd`. It's using `rsync` under the hood to only transfer changes and keeps a capristrano like directory structure:

```sh
$ tree -L 2
.
├── current -> releases/20190725153703
└── releases
    ├── 20190623143320
    ├── 20190723150429
    ├── 20190724151443
    ├── 20190725152609
    └── 20190725153703
```

## install

__a)__ Install all required packages in one shot:

```sh
$ yarn add shipit-cli @uscreen.de/shipit-deploy-cd # or use npm -i
```

__b)__ Or just add `shipit-deploy-cd` to any existing setup:

```sh
$ yarn add @uscreen.de/shipit-deploy-cd # or use npm -i
```

_...will yield if `shipit-cli` missing_

## configure 

Add some proper task configuration to your `shipitfile.js`, example:

```js
// convenience: read app name from it's package.json
const { name } = require('./package.json')

module.exports = shipit => {

  // require and instantiate
  require('@uscreen.de/shipit-deploy-cd')(shipit)

  shipit.initConfig({
    // defaults, every env will inherit from here
    default: {
      dist: 'dist/*', // local source to sync from, can also be an array, like ['public', 'assets']
      deployTo: `/<remote>/<path>/<to>/<deploy>/<to>/${name}`,
      keepReleases: 5 // we keep a copy of last 5 releases
    },

    // example stage server (ssh connection settings)
    stage: {
      servers: 'deploy-stage@stage-deploy-01.example.com'
    },
    
    // example live servers (like above but 2 boxes)
    live: {
      servers: [
        'deploy-live@live-deploy-01.example.com',
        'deploy-live@live-deploy-02.example.com'
        ]
    }
  })

  // convenience: register as 'deploy' task
  shipit.task('deploy', async () => {
    shipit.start('deploy-cd')
  })
}

```

## use

As with all other shipit tasks, this one gets invoked by using the `shipit-cli`, ie.:

```sh
$ shipit stage deploy-cd # or, when registered with another task name
$ shipit stage deploy
```

## Workflow tasks

Following workflow task events are emitted:

- 'deploy'
- 'updated'
- 'published'
- 'cleaned'
- 'deployed'

## Tests

We use Docker to create a host that shipit-deploy-cd can deploy to during testing.

To start the test host, just run

    yarn testhost:start

Attention: Your public SSH keys are read from `~/.ssh/*.pub` and transferred to the test host. This is done to allow shipit-deploy-cd to connect to the test host during the tests.

Before you run the tests first time, you may find it useful to ssh to the service once to confirm the authenticity of the used host:

    ssh root@shipit-deploy-cd-test.uscreen.me -p 2222

Run the tests with

    yarn test

Stop the test host by

    yarn testhost:stop

## Roadmap

- add api/config docs
